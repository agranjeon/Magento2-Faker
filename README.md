# Magento2-Faker

The purpose of this module is to generate loads of fake data to be able to test performance  
It can be used in addition to the magento sample-data, as they only provide products, but not many customers and orders

## Roadmap :

* Optimize product generation
* Retrieve available attribute set for product type and use a random one 
* Fill attribute set's attributes values
* Generate configurable products
* Generate bundle products
