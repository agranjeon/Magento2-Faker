# Magento2-Faker

The purpose of this module is to generate *loads* of fake data to be able to test performance
It can be used in addition to the magento sample-data, as they only provide products, but not many customers and orders

## Roadmap :

Generate data for :
* Category
* Product
* Customer
* Customer Address
* Order
* Invoice
* Shipment
* Rma
